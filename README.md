The example app in this repository is part of [a Smashing Magazine article on Flutter 2](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/03/flutter2-stable-mobile-web-desktop-development-native-speed-one-codebase/)

## Getting started

To build and run this app, after enabling desktop development, run the following command:

~~~
$ flutter create .
~~~

and then build the app using

~~~
$ flutter build ${OS_NAME}
~~~

replacing `${OS_NAME}` with the name of the OS you're running (e.g. `windows` or `linux`).
